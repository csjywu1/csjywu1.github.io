Hello! I am 吴家扬 (Jiayang Wu), a computer science researcher. I focus on research in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and bioinformatics.

My research interests include deep learning, graph neural networks, protein structure prediction, and bioinformatics method development. I am committed to developing innovative algorithms and models to solve complex real-world problems.

Currently, I am actively conducting academic research and look forward to collaborating with peers from academia and industry.
