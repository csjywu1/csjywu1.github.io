Hello! I am 吴家扬 (Jiayang Wu), at Jinan University.  My research interests include graph representation learning, computational biology, and bioinformatics method development. I am supervised by Professor Yefeng Zheng at Westlake University. I am committed to developing innovative algorithms and models to solve complex real-world problems in natural sciences.
